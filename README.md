Hi I am Blake Schulte I am an aerospace engineering student at Iowa State planning to graduate in December of 2024.
I am interested in learning about aerodynamic systems and anything related to aerospace. 
I have done a Summer/Fall co-op and a Summer intership at Collins Aerospace for systems safety and still working part time for the same role.
A hobby of mine is watching movies and playing outdoor games.
